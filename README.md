# Proxmox Backup Server in a Container

[![Docker Image Version (latest semver)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/ayufan/proxmox-backup-server?sort=semver)](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ayufan/proxmox-backup-server)

This is an unofficial compilation of Proxmox Backup Server
to run it in a container for AMD64 and ARM64.

Running in a container might result in some functions not working
properly. Feel free to create an issue to debug those.

## Pre-built images

For starting quickly all images are precompiled and hosted
at https://hub.docker.com/r/ayufan/proxmox-backup-server/tags.

Or:

```bash
docker pull ayufan/proxmox-backup-server:latest
```

## Run

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Then login to `https://<ip>:8007/` with `admin / pbspbs` (Realm: `Proxmox Backup authentication server`).
After that change a password.

## Features

There are some features missing, ex.:

- ZFS (it is not installed in a container)

## Configure

### 1. Add to Proxmox VE

Since it runs in a container, it is by default self-signed.
Follow the tutorial: https://pbs.proxmox.com/docs/pve-integration.html.

You might need to read a PBS fingerprint:

```bash
docker-compose exec server proxmox-backup-manager cert info | grep Fingerprint
```

### 2. Add a new directory to store data

Create a new file: `docker-compose.override.yml`:

```yaml
version: '2.1'

services:
  pbs:
    volumes:
      - backups:/backups

volumes:
  backups:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: ''
      o: bind
      device: /srv/dev-disk-by-label-backups
```

Then, add a new datastore in a PBS: `https://<IP>:8007/`.

### 3. Configure TZ (optional)

If you are running in Docker it might be advised to configure timezone.

Create a new file: `docker-compose.override.yml`:

```yaml
version: '2.1'

services:
  pbs:
    environment:
      TZ: Europe/Warsaw
```

### 4. Persist config, graphs, and logs (optional, but advised)

Create a new file: `docker-compose.override.yml`:

```yaml
version: '2.1'

volumes:
  pbs_etc:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: ''
      o: bind
      device: /srv/pbs/etc
  pbs_logs:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: ''
      o: bind
      device: /srv/pbs/logs
  pbs_lib:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: ''
      o: bind
      device: /srv/pbs/lib
```

## Install on bare-metal host

Docker is convienient, but in some cases it might be simply better to install natively.
Since the packages are built against `Debian Buster` your system needs to run soon
to be stable distribution.

You can copy compiled `*.deb` (it will automatically pick `amd64` or `arm64v8` based on your distribution)
from the container and install:

```bash
cd /tmp
docker run --rm ayufan/proxmox-backup-server:latest tar c /src/ | tar x
apt install $PWD/src/*.deb
```

## Recompile latest version or master

You can compile latest version or master with a set of commands
and push them to the registry.

```bash
# build v1.0.5
make all-build VERSION=v1.0.5

# build master
make all-build

# build and push to registry v1.0.5
make all-push VERSION=v1.0.5 REGISTRY=my.registry.com/pbs

# build and push to registry v1.0.5
make all-push REGISTRY=my.registry.com/pbs

# make the given version latest
make all-latest VERSION=v1.0.5
```

## Build on your own

```bash
make dev-build
```

It builds on any platform, which can be: `amd64`, `arm32v7`, `arm64v8`,
etc. Wait a around 1-3h to compile.

Then you can push to your registry:

```bash
make dev-push
```

Or run locally:

```bash
make dev-shell
make dev-run
```

You might as well pull the `*.deb` from within the image
and install on Debian Bullseye.
